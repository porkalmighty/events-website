# Instructions:

- clone the repo: git clone https://github.com/porkalmighty/idea-theorem-assessment.git
- go inside the folder and run the npm install
- use vscode's live server to run the file
- the fonts can't be read on firefox due to cors policy, vscode live server bypasses this otherwise it works fine on chrome
